# Student Grade Calculator (Python)

A modular **Student Grade Management System** built in **Python**, using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The program allows users to manage students, calculate grades, visualize results, and predict outcomes using a “what-if” analysis.

This project demonstrates clean software design, data persistence, statistical computation, and graphical visualisation suitable for academic submission and portfolio use.

## How Grades Are Calculated

Each subject consists of assessment components whose **weights must total 100%**.

**Formula:** (subject score / max score) × weight

The final subject percentage is the sum of all weighted components.

Overall percentage is calculated as the **average of all valid subject percentages**.

---

## Visualisation

Grades are displayed using bar charts via **Matplotlib**:
- Subject-wise performance
- Overall performance

All graphs scale automatically between 0–100%.

---

## What-If Grade Predictor

The system allows hypothetical predictions such as:

> *“What if I score 75 in the Final Exam?”*

The predictor:
- Temporarily replaces the chosen assessment
- Recalculates the final subject percentage
- Leaves stored data unchanged

---

## Data Storage

All data is stored using **CSV files** managed by Pandas:
- Automatically created and repaired if missing or empty
- Data persists between program runs

---

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
